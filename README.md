## Functionalities of the system
There are three types of Users who will be using this system - Administrator, Faculties, Students. On the web application the administrator will alone have the access to create a new profile and the student and the faculty will be able to access their respective profile created by the administrator .Each user will be limited with their access privileges. Administrator will be able to Add, Delete, and Update the details of the company. The students will have the privilege to modify their personal details. Faculties will be able to access the details of students attended the placement, students and their company details, internships details. Students will be able to Add, Update, Delete their details. The Application can be accessed both inside and outside the Campus, with proper login credentials. Based on Student’s skill sets and company’s requirements new opportunities should be announced on the portal. There should be a facility for generating the report based on the requirement of the client. Students can leave their feedback and complaints on the portal, and the Administrator will be able to see it and make necessary action.
